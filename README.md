## Learning the Ropes with a JavaScript Counter App

Welcome to the Counter App project! This simple application is designed to help you get started with JavaScript by building a basic counter. Through this project, you'll learn fundamental JavaScript concepts and how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).

### Features

- Increment and decrement the counter
- Reset the counter to zero
- Display the current count

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kryssbm99/Counter-App-Js.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Counter-App-Js
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser to see the counter app in action.

### How It Works

The counter app consists of three main parts:

1. **HTML**: The structure of the app, including buttons and display elements.
2. **CSS**: Basic styling to make the app look presentable.
3. **JavaScript**: The logic that makes the counter work.

### JavaScript Concepts Covered

- Variables and data types
- Functions and event listeners
- DOM manipulation
- Basic arithmetic operations

### Conclusion

Building a counter app is a great way to get hands-on experience with JavaScript. It covers essential programming concepts and provides a foundation for more complex projects.
