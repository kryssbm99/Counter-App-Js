## Learning the Ropes with a JavaScript Joke Counter App

Welcome to the Joke Counter App project! This simple application is designed to help you get started with JavaScript by building a basic joke counter. Through this project, you'll learn fundamental JavaScript concepts and how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).

### Features

- Fetch and display a random joke
- Increment the joke counter
- Save jokes to a list
- Clear the list of saved jokes
- Display the current count of jokes fetched

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kryssbm99/Counter-App-Js.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Counter-App-Js
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser to see the joke counter app in action.

### How It Works

The joke counter app consists of three main parts:

1. **HTML**: The structure of the app, including buttons and display elements.
2. **CSS**: Basic styling to make the app look presentable.
3. **JavaScript**: The logic that makes the joke counter work.

### JavaScript Concepts Covered

- Variables and data types
- Functions and event listeners
- DOM manipulation
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- Array operations

### Conclusion

Building a joke counter app is a great way to get hands-on experience with JavaScript. It covers essential programming concepts and provides a foundation for more complex projects.
